# FromZero

A game where the player might enter roguelike-mini dungeons where completing one rewards 
the player by the way he chooses. Those rewards might be a thing that helps his luck with 
finding certain items types in next "dungeons".

This game is made from scratch, and is inspired by the series Handmade Hero.
